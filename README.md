For this project, I was given a basic template that includes a maze layout, movement options (up, down, left, right) 
and a basic reinforcement learning framework. The starter code defined environment parameters, and it was my task to teach the agent 
how to navigate this environment with intelligent behavior. I created a deep Q-Learning model, implementing the neural network to 
approximate the Q-values for each action in a given state. I also defined a reward structure to guide the agent toward optimal 
behavior to find the most efficient path. The training loop included experience replay and epsilon greedy exploration, handling the 
balance between exploration and exploitation over time. I optimized the exploration factor to achieve faster and higher success rates.

This is a strong practice example for how computer scientists solve real-world problems by designing, building, and analyzing
algorithms, systems, and applications, creating technology that impacts nearly every vocation. A computer scientist's role is to push 
the boundaries of what machines can do, driving innovation, improving quality of life, and providing solutions to complex challenges. 
The reinforcement modle I built in this project reflects a small part of autonomous machine learning which has become a crucial part 
of innovation in every field where machines are used.

Throughout my education and career as a computer scientist, the prevailing theme has been to approach every problem with the same
method - break down complex tasks into manageable components, identify existing solutions to those components and use those where 
possible, create new solutions where existing ones are not a good fit, and map out the solutions iteratively. Early designs are rarely
ideal solutions and components require fine tuning to make them operate in concert, so critical thinking, experimentation, and analysis 
are essential tools in the field of computer science.

In addition to the practical factors of problem solving in computer science, computer scientsts are at the forefront of the 
philosophical issues in today's society as well. The ethical responsibility to prioritize safety, privacy, and fairness in systems 
built by computer scientists has become a driving force in designing those systems. It is paramount that our programs behave reliably, 
protect senstive user data, and avoid biases that could impact undesirable results. Design transparency, accountability for outcomes, 
and designing with ethical principles are fundamental duties of a computer scientist. We must always keep both users' and 
organizations' best interests in mind when developing machine solutions to human problems.
